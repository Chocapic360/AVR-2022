## Attaching Motors to Arms

Inside each motor box there is bag of 4 x 8mm screws and other components. You will only be using the screws for assembly. In your AVR kit you will also find a ziploc bag of M3 washers. Make sure to secure each screw with a washer.

Please be sure to use the screws provided in the small ziploc bag inside the motor box. **Using longer screws from the kit can end up damaging the motor windings and ultimately prevent the motor from operating.**

The photo below shows the necessary parts for mounting the motor to frame arm. You will follow this procedure for each of the four motor/arm assemblies.

A 2mm hex driver is necessary to secure each of the M3 screws into the motor.

Make note of the blue loctite already applied to each of the screws in the photo below. Loctite is useful in helping secure your screws and prevents them from coming loose.

A tube of blue loctite is included in your AVR kit and is recommended throughout the build process. We'll make a callout, or show a photo, whenever we recommend using loctite.

Repeat this process for all four of the motors and set your arms aside for now. We will be attaching them to the mid-section of the frame in an upcoming step.
