## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the Bell Advanced Vertical Robotics competition!
Be sure to pay attention to the navigation links on the left and please keep in mind
that this documentation is a **living document** that will be constantly updated over time.
There will be new sections added, typos fixed, and bugs squashed throughout
this process.

## Requirements

To be able to successfully compete in AVR, you must have the following
available to you:

- A 3D printer (8.5" cubed) with 1 roll of ABS filament
- A laptop with one of the following:
  - Windows 10/11 with admin privileges
  - x86 MacOS (M1 chips are not supported yet for AVR)
  - Ubuntu 20.04+-based Linux (Pop!\_OS, Mint, etc) with `sudo` privileges
- Basic shop tools and supplies:
  - Zip ties
  - Soldering iron
  - Screwdrivers
  - Basic nut drivers / hex keys (mostly metric M3 / M2.5 sizes)
  - Scissors / wire cutters
  - Heat shrink
  - etc.

A good kit that contains most of the tools that you will need can be found here:

## Prerequisites

For AVR, you'll need to 3D print some parts for your drone.
While not needed immediately, these are good to get started with:

- Landing Gear
  - AVR-LANDING-GEAR-MOUNT (x4)
  - AVR-LANDING-GEAR-BRACE (x4)
  - AVR-LANDING-GEAR-FOOT (x4)
- Mounts
  - AVR-CAM-ZED-MINI-MOUNT (x1)
  - AVR-BATTERY-STANDOFF-SMC (X1)
- Gimbal
  - AVR-GIMBAL-BASE (x1)
  - AVR-GIMBAL-PAN (x1)
  - AVR-GIMBAL-TILT (x1)
