In writing software for your drone, you will both need to interact with the sandbox environment as well as collaborate with your peers working on code from different machines. "Git" is built for tracking and managing changes between files. It is a staple of modern code management.

To install Git, simply select the standalone installer from the [git-scm website](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

Run through the installation process. Once the install is completed, you will need to setup a username and email address for your machine.

To set up a username and password, open a terminal and type the following:

```bash
git config --global user.name "yourusername"
```

```bash
git config --global user.email "email@youremail.com"
```

Remember this email, because you will need to add it to your GitHub account later.
