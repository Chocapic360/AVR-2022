For teams that want to write their own code to run on their drone,
we recommend doing so through the "sandbox" in the GitHub repository:
[https://github.com/bellflight/VRC-2022/tree/main/VMC/sandbox](https://github.com/bellflight/VRC-2022/tree/main/VMC/sandbox).
This has already been configured to be very simple to get started with.

1. Edit the contents of `VMC/sandbox/sandbox.py` with your desired code.
   Read the comments within the file to understand what's going on
2. Un-comment the sandbox module from the `docker-compose.yml` file to enable it
   with the rest of the VMC software
3. Run `sudo docker-compose build sandbox` to ensure the built Docker
   container contains the latest version of your code

With that, you can start the VRC software like normal!
Your code will run alongside the rest of the VMC modules.
