As part of Phase 1 of the AVR, all members on the team will work together as a
group to conceptualize, design, fabricate, assemble, and test a
solution to address two needs

1. Create an “LED Halo” that will serve as a signaling device.
   The LED Halo is a custom-built bracket that houses the LED Strip.
2. Design a mechanism that the AVR drone will use to hold, drop, and reciever water to
   the Open Roof Buildings.

The designs should be lightweight to minimize the impact on the
aircraft’s stability and endurance, yet strong enough to withstand
handling loads. Teams will be provided STL files of the following
as optional starting points for their designs:

Although 3D printing is a great manufacturing capability,
_the components do not have to be 3D printed_.
Teams are welcome to use other manufacturing methods as
long as their design does not break the rules as described in the game manual.
