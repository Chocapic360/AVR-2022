title: "Flight Modes and Kill Switch"

The primary goal of the basic assembly is to be able to pilot the VRC drone in stabilized mode.
Therefore we will configure SWB (3 position switch) to control which flight
mode we're in. In addition to setting up flight modes, we will also enable a kill
switch on SWD (2 position switch). This is **VERY IMPORTANT** in case the
VRC drone needs to be shut down due to a fly-away or complete loss of control.
The video below demonstrates this process.
