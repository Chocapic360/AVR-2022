## Safety Setup

Previously, in the RC Transmitter Setup section, we covered
[Setting Up Failsafe]({{< relref "../../rc-transmitter-setup/setting-up-failsafe" >}}).
In QGC we need to make sure we disable some of the failsafe options, as many of
them are related to GPS-enabled drones. VRC is all about indoor navigation in a
GPS-denied environment therefore it warrants a different safety configuration.
The video below walks through the setup process.

## Disable Safety Switch

Bell VRC is about navigating indoors in a **GPS-denied** environment.
In many cases, users of GPS-based drones have a safety switch to pre-arm their drone.
Since we do not have the requirement of this hardware we will need to
disable the pre-arm check.

To do this we will change one parameter in PX4's configuration known as
**CBRK_IO_SAFETY**. You can find
[all PX4 parameters here](https://docs.px4.io/v1.11/en/advanced_config/parameter_reference.html).
It's not important to understand all of these parameters, although it is
important to understand the process of changing them, as this will be necessary
for Phase 2 of VRC.

In the video below we give an overview of why this parameter needs to be
changed and how to do it. You will learn how to assign a value of **22027**
(disabled) to **CBRK_IO_SAFETY**.
