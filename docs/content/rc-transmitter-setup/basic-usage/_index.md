To turn on the transmitter, press and hold the two power buttons on the front of
the device until the screen lights up. After you see the logo, you will be presented
with the home screen.

You might see a warning when you turn on the transmitter about switch positions.
Just follow the instructions provided on the screen to continue to the home screen.

The transmitter contains a touch screen used for displaying status info and for setup
purposes. The home screen has three different views. You can switch views by swiping
left and right, where the bottom indicator shows you which screen you are on
(when you start the transmitter, you see the center screen).

The left screen shows you the current value sent over all channels,
while the right screen shows information about sensors connected to the transmitter.

One thing that is helpful to gain an understanding of how your flight sticks
map to various channels is to swipe to the channel view and move your sticks around.
You should see the channel values update as you move the left and right sticks.

Configuration is done by pressing the icon with the wrench and screwdriver
on the center home screen. The next screen has two different views: the
**function** view and the **system** view. The **function** view provides options that
change how the different sticks, buttons, and dials on the transmitter are
transformed to channel values.

The **system** view provides options for setting up the transmitter itself.
You can change to the **system** view by pressing **SYS**.
