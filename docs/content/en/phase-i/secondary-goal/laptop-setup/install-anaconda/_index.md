**Anaconda will allow us to create what's called a
[virtual environment](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-you-need-python-environments-and-how-to-manage-them-with-conda-85f155f4353c/),
which will contain all of the necessary Python libraries we need to
develop for the VRC platform.**

You can find the download links [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
