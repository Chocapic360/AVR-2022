Start by downloading the operating system for the Jetson from Nvidia's website
[here](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/downloads).
At the time of writing it is a 6 gigabyte file so it may take a while.

- Once that's downloaded, open Balena Etcher.
- Click "Flash from file" and select the file we just downloaded
- Make sure your SD card is inserted

If you're flashing an SD card that's been used before
(or if, let's say, you're starting over) make sure to format the SD Card
using the SD Card formatter we downloaded earlier.
